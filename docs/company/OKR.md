# DonaTalk — OKRs

> Cycle 1 | Set 2026-07-08 | Horizon: 48h operational proof, then rolling
> Owner: Board sets objectives; CEO owns key results.

## Obj 1 — Stand up a safe, self-operating operations environment

| KR | Target | Measure | Status |
|----|--------|---------|--------|
| **1-1** | ≥16 consecutive scheduled runs (3h + daily) over 48h complete with success exit, **zero unhandled failures**; every failure auto-classified to an `ALERT-*` file. | `ops/logs/` run history | ⬜ not started |
| **1-2** | `METRICS.md` catalog exists; **100%** of runs append a timestamped row to awareness / funnel / ops-health logs. | metric CSVs | ⬜ not started |
| **1-3** | Governance Charter in force with machine-enforced escalation gates; verified by a dry-run that trips a gate. | `CHARTER.md` + dry-run log | ✅ verified 2026-07-09: money-gate dry-run tripped the §3b scanner in `deploy-web.ps1` — touched `lib/updateFunds.ts`, wrapper exited 10, wrote `ALERT-deploy-20260709T134414Z.txt`, did NOT deploy (change routed to PR, never merged; money edit reverted) |
| **1-4** | Synthetic health probe on app.donatalk.com critical paths every 6h, self-cleaning, auto-rollback wired. | `ops/check-site.ps1` + probe log | 🟡 probe live + green each run (3 paths, 200+marker); auto-rollback wrapper `ops/deploy-web.ps1` built 2026-07-09. **Fixed 2026-07-09: the wrapper (and all `ops/*.ps1`) failed to parse under Windows PowerShell 5.1 — non-ASCII `§`/`—` with no BOM broke `deploy-web.ps1:62`; would have been dead-on-arrival on the scheduler host. Now pure-ASCII + PS5.1 parse-verified; gate-trip path proven live.** 6h cadence still needs scheduler host (item 6). **Rollback branch now self-tested 2026-07-09 via `deploy-web.ps1 -SelfTestRollback` (dry-run rollback + re-probe, no live outage); found+fixed a return-stream bug.** Only true live-fire on a real failing deploy remains (deferred — needs a controlled window, not autonomous prod-break) |

## Obj 2 — Increase DonaTalk's search visibility

| KR | Target | Measure | Status |
|----|--------|---------|--------|
| **2-1** | Keyword-strategy doc: **3 validated non-branded clusters** (volume + difficulty), each mapped to a target page. | `plans/seo-keyword-strategy.md` | ✅ done 2026-07-09 (clusters A/B/C; volumes SERP-inferred, confirm w/ tool) |
| **2-2** | GSC verified on **both** `donatalk.com` and `app.donatalk.com`; sitemaps submitted; baseline captured (indexed pages, impressions, avg position, top-10 queries); metric funnel defined. | `metrics/` + GSC | ✅ GSC+GA4 confirmed, baseline captured, **both sitemaps submitted** (WP + app) 2026-07-09 |
| **2-2a** | App SEO foundation shipped: `app/robots.ts`, `app/sitemap.ts`, OG/Twitter tags, per-profile metadata, JSON-LD. | app source + deploy | ✅ deployed v0.12.0 (PR #21) 2026-07-09; verified live (robots.txt, sitemap 42 URLs, per-profile OG/JSON-LD); probe green |
| **2-3** | ≥ **[TBD after baseline]** do-follow backlinks from ≥ **[TBD]** distinct domains, tracked in `backlink-ledger.md`. | `metrics/backlink-ledger.md` | 🟡 target list built 2026-07-10 (`research/backlink-targets.md` — communities, do-follow guest-post pubs, DR-70+ directories, cause/CSR venues; sourced). Ledger still empty (0) — **execution gated on approved posting accounts (#15)**. Numeric targets still `[TBD]` pending tool baseline. |

### Open sizing
Numeric targets on 2-1/2-3 are set **after** the GSC baseline lands — sizing them
blind would be guessing. Placeholder `[TBD]` until then.

## Board decisions applied to this cycle (2026-07-08)
- Autonomy: **full auto-deploy** (fenced by Deploy Gates, `CHARTER.md` §4).
- SEO surfaces: **both** app + WordPress.
- Posting: **fully autonomous** (fenced by Posting Guardrails, `CHARTER.md` §7).

## Blockers requiring board action
1. ~~Charter sign-off~~ ✅ done (PR #18, 2026-07-09).
2. ~~Google Search Console verification~~ ✅ confirmed both domains + baseline (2026-07-09).
3. ~~WordPress application-password~~ ✅ obtained, verified (admin), stored in Vercel (2026-07-09). **Rotate — rode through chat.**
4. Always-on scheduler host (Windows Task Scheduler box or VM).
5. Approved posting accounts/platforms.
